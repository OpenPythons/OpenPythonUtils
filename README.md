# OpenPython

![Python Interpreter in OpenPython v1.0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21021916/47162981-0163aa80-d330-11e8-9e54-7b470a5e67b0.png)

**OpenPython makes micropython available on OpenComputers.**

micropython is Python for embedded devices and is different from CPython.
Currently, micropython is partially compatible with Python version 3.4 as of October 2018.

Features include:
- Fully persistable.
- Runs in a sandboxed environment and does not require a separate native DLL.
- Supports virtual file system.
- It can call other components and supports Lua architecture's UserData.

Limitations include:
- The firmware is 256 KB and the memory limit has the same limit as the Lua architecture, but the stack is allocated in a separate memory.
- Most modules are difficult to use because the battery is partially included.
- The operating system is not yet fully implemented, so the Python interpreter now runs.
- Ctrl + C is not supported, so if you accidentally run infinite repeated code

To use the Python architecture, you need the following items:
- EEPROM (OpenPython): I'm sorry, but you have to bring items from the Creative tab.
- Floppy Disk (OpenPython OS): This item can be obtained by creating a floppy disk and Scrench, or you can check it on the Creative tab.
- OpenPython CPU: You can choose OpenPython architecture by holding Shift + Right Click on the Lua architecture CPU.

It is still unstable, but we plan to make further improvements in the future.

I need help from people who are familiar with OpenComputers and Python.

Thank you for playing.
